After cramming for the TOEFL exam for just one day, I managed to get a satisfying score: **L30, W30, R28**. Here are some preparation materials and tips that I found especially helpful for short-term preparation.

## ✍️ Writing

A big shoutout to [Vince](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UaxueAEv6?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.0&vd_source=3154159463fb2054a6a29dbc19b73f67) for his insightful video on writing strategies. Below are my main takeaways:

### 🧠 Integrated Writing
- During the **3-minute reading**, write down the main point and supporting details.
- For the **listening**, capture the speaker’s arguments *and* their examples — include specific details.
- Structure the essay to balance content from both sources, roughly a 1:1.2 ratio of reading to listening.
- Use the original wording from the reading — no need for heavy paraphrasing.
- Reserve 1–2 minutes at the end for proofreading.

### 💬 Independent Writing
- Use a solid structure:  
  **Main argument** → **Specific examples** → **Concession** (e.g., *Granted... however...*) → **Conclusion**
- Clarity and coherence matter more than fancy vocabulary.

## 🎧 Listening & 📖 Reading

The [Official Guide video](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/about/content.html) gives a good overview of the format.

For **listening**:
- Focus on following the speaker’s logic.
- Take notes on the **main thread** and **key details** (examples, shifts in topic, emphasis).

For **reading**:
- Skim the passage first, put down the main points and main details, and then dive into the questions.

Still a work in progress... 😭
