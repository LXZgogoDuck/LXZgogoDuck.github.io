After cramming for the IELTS exam in just three days, I managed to score **L9, R8.5, W7.5** (S6.5 still working on speaking 😅). Here’s a breakdown of what I did and found helpful — in case you ever need to speedrun the IELTS too.

## 🎯 1. Useful Platforms

- **[Clarity English: Road to IELTS](http://salicentre.cuhk.edu.cn/v2/login)** (via CUHKSZ self-learning portal)
- **New Oriental Mock Test Platform:** [https://ieltscat.xdf.cn/mock](https://ieltscat.xdf.cn/mock)
- **TalkFriend 小程序** — helpful for simulating speaking tasks

## 📝 2. Writing

Big thanks to [Simon's video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HQMHziExA/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=3154159463fb2054a6a29dbc19b73f67) for writing structure tips.
My tip is familiarizing yourself to the writing structures and spending as less time as possible in the first task. Also, reading Simon's sample writing will greatly help.

## 🎧 3. Listening

- I used **雅思小站 app** for timed listening and scored myself every day (~1.25x speed).  
- Reinforced key vocab with TalkFriend or IELTS词汇库.
- Strategy: Listen for main thread + keywords; don't try to transcribe everything.

## 📚 4. Reading

- Practice on New Oriental platform.
- Learn to spot keyword positions and paraphrasing cues quickly.
- Focus on understanding logic and flow — not memorization.

---

## 🗣️ 5. Speaking

- Practiced using mock questions and TalkFriend.
- I also watched Part 1 & 2 practice videos on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/).
- Speaking is my weakest area (still TBD 😭), but even just familiarizing yourself with the format helps a lot.

Good luck! 🍀
