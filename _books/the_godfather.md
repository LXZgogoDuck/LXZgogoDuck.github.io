The poor want to climb up the ladder of the social hierarchy, while the rich on the top constantly kick them away. I am deeply impressed by how Dickens use his humor, his sarcasm, his deep investigation into the society to illustrate a vivid picture of London.

This complex serialized novel explores law, class, and bureaucracy in 19th-century London through a cast of vivid characters and a dual narrative structure. I found the themes of systemic delay and social decay incredibly compelling, especially in light of Berman’s reading of modernity.

In Tutorial 3, we focused on the **importance of illustration** in the periodical edition. One key takeaway was how visual culture shaped Victorian readers’ experience of serialized fiction. I analyzed an illustration depicting **Jo the crossing sweeper**, reflecting on the visual framing of poverty and innocence.
