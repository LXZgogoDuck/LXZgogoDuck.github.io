I encountered this book at a second-hand book stalls. It accompanied me during my journey to Barcelona and in my train to London. I could still remember how sentences flow to form a picture, a world in my mind.

Read as part of my Oxford literature tutorials with [Dr. Charlotte Jones](https://www.english.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-charlotte-jones). This novel was paired with Woolf’s short story *The Mark on the Wall*, Bertrand Russell’s *The Problems of Philosophy*, and critical texts on **modernist perception and vagueness**.

Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness style and fluid temporality challenged my understanding of narrative structure. What stood out was her treatment of time as **psychological and social**, not merely chronological — especially in the "Time Passes" section, where the war happens almost silently, offstage.

I also explored how the novel blurs **internal vs. external reality**, especially through Lily Briscoe’s painting process, and how that resonates with Woolf’s philosophy of art and consciousness.
