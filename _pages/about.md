  I love music, dance, and nature. I'm a devoted fan of Hua Chenyu, whose songs have been a constant source of warmth and inspiration. Thanks to my mother’s encouragement, I’ve practiced piano and Chinese classical dance for over 15 years. I also love <a href="https://users.ox.ac.uk/~climbing/Home.html">mountaineering</a> and currently learning Korean in my free time.

I’m **Xuanzhuo Liu (刘萱卓)**, a junior undergraduate in Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I've spent a wonderful year at the **University of Oxford**, studying Mathematics and Computer Science through the [Visiting Student Programme](https://www.st-hildas.ox.ac.uk/news/st-hildas-visiting-student-programme). At Oxford, I research **transformer-based policies** and **generalist agents** in the [WhiRL group](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/), focusing on multimodal perception and instruction-following for robotics.

At CUHK(SZ), I worked with [Prof. Haizhou Li](https://www.colips.org/~eleliha/) and [Prof. Shuang Li](https://shuangli01.github.io/) on **cognitive modeling and multimodal attention**, studying how humans process audiovisual signals and how to model the human perception–reasoning loop.

In Summer 2025, I will join [Prof. Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/)'s lab at the **University of Chicago** via the [Student Summer Research Fellowship Program](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/academics/undergraduate/summer-research/student-summer-research-fellowship-program/), working on **learning and decision-making under uncertainty**.

My research interests include:
- **Embodied intelligence** and sequential decision-making  
- **Representation learning**, attention, and generalization  
- **Symbolic–neural integration** and human-aligned reasoning  

I’m especially motivated by challenges at the intersection of **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **cognitive systems**, and I aspire to pursue a PhD focused on building **robust, generalizable, and interpretable intelligent agents**.
