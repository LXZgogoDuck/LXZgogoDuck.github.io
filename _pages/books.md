## ðŸ“š Oxford Tutorial Readings (2025)

Iâ€™ve been fortunate to embark on a rich journey through English literature under the guidance of [Dr. Charlotte Jones](https://www.english.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-charlotte-jones) â€” a deeply thoughtful and inspiring tutor. These books were central to an interdisciplinary exploration of **Victorian realism**, **modernism**, **urbanity**, and **essayistic form**, and each offered a unique lens on how literature shapes and reflects human experience.

Below is a curated shelf of the texts I engaged with during my time at Oxford.
